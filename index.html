        <h2>Welcome to my page</h2>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my page. I have enjoyed the time it has taken to learn more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to be able to present you with this page. Much of the work that I put into this has come from many aspects of my pursuit in obtaining my BSIT at KSU. I will go into more depth about this in the About portion of my website. I hope you enjoy it, and if you haven't yet, enjoy the fun game provided on this page to get to know me a little more. If you have, I hope you feel as if you know a little more about me now.</p>
