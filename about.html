                <p>My name is Grant Davies, and I am a Junior at KSU. I am currently working at GTRI as a student assistant fielding helpdesk tickets supporting the Advanced Concepts Lab. I live in Decatur GA with my girlfriend and our dog and cat. When not at work or working on class work I enjoy spending time with friends playing board games and eating great food. At one point in my life, I aspired to make it on to the Magic the Gathering Pro Tour. I still enjoy playing Magic as much as I can, but in a much more casual setting. Gaming certainly is something that I will always look to when I find leisure time. For now, I am trying to stay as focused as possible on the next few semesters and graduate.
        
                <p>have always enjoyed puzzles and troubleshooting and found quickly that much of IT is just that. I enrolled at KSU and began my path towards a degree in Information Technology. Along the way, I have expanded on some skills I had developed earlier in life with other careers and my education is providing me with many new tools to present to potential employers after graduation. Including the ability to compose and design websites!</p> 

                <p>I started my journey at KSU almost four years ago when I was two years out of leaving my job of 11 years at Quiktrip. I found myself wanting more out of the work I put in every day and as much as a great job Quiktirp was, it did not leave me fulfilled on a daily basis. Shortly after I left Quiktirp, a friend informed me that they had a position opening the tax software company he worked at. There I took on the role of client facing for the delivery team. It was my responsibility to ensure that when tax assessments and bills were released, I contacted the customer and confirmed the data we had received from the assessors and collectors was current and accurate in our database and packaged in a compatible .csv file for the tax software most of these companies used. During my time there I was thrust into a position where I had to learn SQL and Python fairly quickly. I found myself excited everyday troubleshooting issues and working with the data team to ensure we were delivering the proper product. This lasted roughly 11 months then Covid-19 shook the world and the company quickly found out that businesses were trying to save money everywhere they could, and consulting was quick to get the axe. The company was kind enough to give me a severance package to help me through the first few months of my work displacement, but opportunities for work were few and far between. A few months of job hunting I was tipped about an opportunity at Georgia Power. They were hiring engineers for the distribution control center where they centrally controlled many of the distribution switches that powered much of the state. I felt very encouraged by my interview and was eagerly waiting for a call back. A week passes and I finally hear word, “Good afternoon Mr. Davies. I just wanted to reach out to you personally to inform you that we have decided not to pursue you further with the vacancy at the DCC. I do however want to encourage you that if you are able to further your education, you would make a wonderful candidate and we wish you would reapply upon completion of an undergraduate degree. We felt compelled to only proceed with candidates that already meet this requirement.” I thanked them for their time and the opportunity to interview, but it was set, no amount of work history and experience was going to carry the weight that an undergraduate degree would. As such, I am in the process of attaining my undergraduate with the hopes of better employment opportunities upon graduation.</p>
